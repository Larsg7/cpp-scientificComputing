// (a) Write a program that replaces every second element of an array by zero,
// using a for loop and iterating with step size two.

// (b) Write a program that prints out all odd numbers smaller than 20 by
// using a loop and the continue statements.

//(c) Write a program that calculates the largest factorial smaller than a given
//upper limit. Therefore use a loop and the break statement to exit, when
//the next number is larger than the limit.

//(d) Binomial coeﬃcient
//Write a program that computes the binomial coeﬃcient  (n k)
//where n and k are speciﬁed by the user.

//(e) Password prompt
//Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. The user may
//only enter the password a speciﬁed number of times. The program should
//check the password every time and exit if the correct password was given
//or the maximal limit is reached.

//(f) The guessing game
//Write program that randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 and
//the user has to guess this number. If the user guesses too high/low the
//program outputs ”too high/low” until the user hits the correct number.
